# Salted Caramel
A Minecraft mod that is centered on improving / overhauling Vanilla progression while also adding other new features

IMPORTANT: This mod is *highly recommended* to be used as a standalone mod, otherwise some features / gameplay elements may clash with other mods, bringing an unpleasant experience

The mod will only be available for Fabric, but a NeoForge port may be considered if the mod becomes popular enough
